In TypeScript, you can use the keywords 'static', 'protected', and 'private' to control the visibility and accessibility of your properties and methods. A STATIC member is a member of a class that belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. You can access static members using the class name, rather than an instance of the class. You might use static members when you want to define a utility function or a constant that is related to a class, but that does not depend on the state of any particular instance of that class.

A PROTECTED member is a member of a class that can be accessed only by the class itself and by subclasses of the class. You might use protected members when you want to define behavior that is common to all subclasses of a class, but that should not be exposed to external code. A PRIVATE member is a member of a class that can be accessed by the class itself. You might use private members when you want to hide the implementation details of a class from the external code, or when you want to prevent external code from modifying the state of an object.

When using these keywords, you can create more robust and maintainable code by controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members, and by promoting code reuse, flexability, and encapsulation.
